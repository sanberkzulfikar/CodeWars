// Bumps in the Road (7 kyu)
// https://www.codewars.com/kata/57ed30dde7728215300005fa/

// Description:

// Your car is old, it breaks easily. The shock absorbers are gone and you think it can handle about 15 more bumps before it dies totally.

// Unfortunately for you, your drive is very bumpy! Given a string showing either flat road (_) or bumps (n). If you are able to reach home safely by encountering 15 bumps or less, return Woohoo!, otherwise return Car Dead

// My Solution:

function bump(x){
  let bla = x.split('')
  let count = 0
  for(let i=0; i<=bla.length-1; i++){
    if(bla[i] === "n")
    count++
  }
  return count <= 15 ? "Woohoo!" : "Car Dead"
}
