// Removing Elements (8kyu)
// https://www.codewars.com/kata/5769b3802ae6f8e4890009d2/train/javascript

// Description: 

// Take an array and remove every second element from the array. Always keep the first element and start removing with the next element.

// Example:
// ["Keep", "Remove", "Keep", "Remove", "Keep", ...] --> ["Keep", "Keep", "Keep", ...]

// None of the arrays will be empty, so you don't have to worry about that!

// My Solution: 

function removeEveryOther(arr) {
    let newArr = []
    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i += 2) {
        newArr.push(arr[i])
    }
    arr = newArr
    return arr
}
