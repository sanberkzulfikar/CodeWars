// Predict your age! (7 kyu)
// https://www.codewars.com/kata/5aff237c578a14752d0035ae/

// Description:

// My grandfather always predicted how old people would get, and right before he passed away he revealed his secret!

// In honor of my grandfather's memory we will write a function using his formula!

// Take a list of ages when each of your great-grandparent died.
// Multiply each number by itself.
// Add them all together.
// Take the square root of the result.
// Divide by two.
// Example
// predictAge(65, 60, 75, 55, 60, 63, 64, 45) === 86
// Note: the result should be rounded down to the nearest integer.

// Some random tests might fail due to a bug in the JavaScript implementation. Simply resubmit if that happens to you.

// My Solution:

function predictAge(age1,age2,age3,age4,age5,age6,age7,age8){
  let arr = [age1,age2,age3,age4,age5,age6,age7,age8]
  arr = arr.map(x => {
    return x*x
  })
  let sum = 0
  for(let i =0; i<=arr.length-1; i++){
    sum = sum + arr[i]
  }
  sum = Math.sqrt(sum)
  sum = sum / 2
  sum = Math.floor(sum)
  return sum
}
