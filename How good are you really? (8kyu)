// Description: 

// There was a test in your class and you passed it. Congratulations!
// But you're an ambitious person. You want to know if you're better than the average student in your class.

// You receive an array with your peers' test scores. Now calculate the average and compare your score!

// Return True if you're better, else False!

// Note:
// Your points are not included in the array of your class's points. For calculating the average point you may add your point to the given array!

// My Solution:

function betterThanAverage(classPoints, yourPoints) {
    let sum = 0
    let avg = 0
    classPoints.push(yourPoints)
    for (let element of classPoints) {
        sum = sum + element
    }
    avg = sum / classPoints.length
    if (yourPoints > avg) {
        return true
    }
    else {
        return false
    }
}
