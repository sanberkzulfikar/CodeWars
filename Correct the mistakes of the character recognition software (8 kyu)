// Description:

// Character recognition software is widely used to digitise printed texts. Thus the texts can be edited, searched and stored on a computer.

// When documents (especially pretty old ones written with a typewriter), are digitised character recognition softwares often make mistakes.

// Your task is correct the errors in the digitised text. You only have to handle the following mistakes:

// S is misinterpreted as 5
// O is misinterpreted as 0
// I is misinterpreted as 1
// The test cases contain numbers only by mistake.


// My Solution:

function correct(string) {
  let newArr = []
  for(let i=0; i<=string.length-1; i++){
    if(string[i] === '5'){
      newArr.push('S')
    }
    else if(string[i] === '1') {
      newArr.push('I')
    }
    else if(string[i] === '0'){
      newArr.push('O')
    }
    else{
      newArr.push(string[i])
    }
  }
  return newArr.join('')
}
