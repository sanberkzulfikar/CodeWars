// I love you, a little , a lot, passionately ... not at all (8 kyu)
// https://www.codewars.com/kata/57f24e6a18e9fad8eb000296/

// Description:

// Who remembers back to their time in the schoolyard, when girls would take a flower and tear its petals, saying each of the following phrases each time a petal was torn:

// "I love you"
// "a little"
// "a lot"
// "passionately"
// "madly"
// "not at all"
// If there are more than 6 petals, you start over with "I love you" for 7 petals, "a little" for 8 petals and so on.

// When the last petal was torn there were cries of excitement, dreams, surging thoughts and emotions.

// Your goal in this kata is to determine which phrase the girls would say at the last petal for a flower of a given number of petals. The number of petals is always greater than 0.

// My Solution:

function howMuchILoveYou(nbPetals) {
  let arr = ["I love you", "a little", "a lot", "passionately", "madly", "not at all"]
  if(nbPetals <= 6) {
    return arr[nbPetals-1]
  }
  else if (nbPetals % 6 === 0){
    return arr[5]
  }
  else {
    nbPetals = nbPetals % 6 -1
    return arr[nbPetals]
  }
}
