// Capitalization and Mutability (8 kyu)
// https://www.codewars.com/kata/595970246c9b8fa0a8000086/

// Description:

// Your coworker was supposed to write a simple helper function to capitalize a string (that contains a single word) before they went on vacation.

// My Solution:

function capitalizeWord(word) {
  let result = [];
  result.push(word[0].toUpperCase());
  for (let i = 1; i <= word.length - 1; i++) {
    result.push(word[i]);
  }
  return result.join("");
}
