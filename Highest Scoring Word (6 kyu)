// Highest Scoring Word (6 kyu)
// https://www.codewars.com/kata/57eb8fcdf670e99d9b000272/

// Description:

// Given a string of words, you need to find the highest scoring word.

// Each letter of a word scores points according to its position in the alphabet: a = 1, b = 2, c = 3 etc.

// For example, the score of abad is 8 (1 + 2 + 1 + 4).

// You need to return the highest scoring word as a string.

// If two words score the same, return the word that appears earliest in the original string.

// All letters will be lowercase and all inputs will be valid.

// My Solution:

function high(x) {
    let points = 0
    let points2nd = 0
    let theTargetIndex = 0
    let alphabet = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz".split('')
    x = x.split(' ')
    for (let i = 0; i <= x.length - 1; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j <= x[i].length - 1; j++) {
            points2nd = points2nd + (alphabet.indexOf(x[i][j]) + 1)
        }
        if (points2nd > points) {
            points = points2nd
            theTargetIndex = i
        }
        points2nd = 0
    }
    return x[theTargetIndex]
}
