// Remove First and Last Character (8 kyu)
// https://www.codewars.com/kata/56bc28ad5bdaeb48760009b0/

// Description:

// It's pretty straightforward. Your goal is to create a function that removes the first and last characters of a string. You're given one parameter, the original string. You don't have to worry with strings with less than two characters.


// My Solution:

function removeChar(str) {
  str = str.split('')
  str.pop()
  str.shift()
  str = str.join('')
  return str
};
